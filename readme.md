# Pingkikai

Pingkikai is a dead simple application that allows you to check if a website is down or not, quite useless if you ask me. I made this as my first ever Rust project, so the entire code of this application has been possible thanks to:

- [The Rust Programming Language - Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/)
- [iced.rs API Reference](https://docs.rs/iced/latest/iced/)
- [Building a simple text editor with iced - Tutorial Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcBJ7cPSALo&t=573s)

My goal with this application is to learn as much as I can about Rust and, of course, Iced. In the future, I'd like to make a gallery application I like enjoy using in my Silverblue desktop.
